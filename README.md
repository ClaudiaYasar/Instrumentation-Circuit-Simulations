# Instrumentation-Circuit-Simulations
This module provides simulations on basic instrumentation, DC circuit analysis, and sensor measurement methods. It includes scope and generator use, circuit computations, Simscape modeling, Wheatstone bridge techniques, and applications with thermistors and strain gauges.


# Acknowledgment

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Marco Rossi from MathWorks for his valuable support, and to my students from the Control and Automation Engineering Department, particularly those enrolled in Fundamentals of Electrical Networks, Circuit Analysis and Synthesis, and Measurement and Sensors for Control Engineers, for their engagement and contributions.
